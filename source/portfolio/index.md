This project is a 2D platformer game, in which the players could explore multiple themed worlds, using sword and elementary magics to fight against various bosses. I worked on this title for about 4 months with a team of 5, including another programmer and 3 artists. I mainly focused on the design and programming work of enemy AI, and Boss Fights. I also intructed the artist team for the creation of the tilemap, designed the level blocks in the 3.0 version and coded for the level random generating algorithms.
