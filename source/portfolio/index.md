* Role: Gameplay Programmer & Level Designer
* Period: July 2019 - November 2019
* Engine: Unity
* Specical: Won Tencent 2019 Next Idea Excellence Award [(Top 16)](https://gameinstitute.qq.com/yxds-2019/works/vote#gameNav)

This project is a 2D platformer game where players could explore multiple themed worlds, using swords and elementary magics to fight against various bosses. I worked on this title for about 4 months with a team of 5, including another programmer and 3 artists. I mainly focused on the design and programming work of enemy AI and Boss Fights. I also instructed the artist team to create the tilemap, designed the level blocks in the 3.0 version, and coded for the level random generating algorithms.

* Role: Game Designer & Programmer
* Period: October 2020 - December 2020; April 2021 - May 2021
* Engine: Cocos Creator, Agora, WebAudio
* Special: First performed at Beijing 798 Art Zone. Sponsored by Goethe Institute Beijing.

This project is an interactive music performance experience. I cooperated with musician and artist Clore Cai and tried to provide a space for the audience to contribute to the sound field through their new organ: the smartphone. I used Cocos Creator to create a juicy user interface based on Html5. I utilized WebAudio to make it possible for the players to generate and modify the music from their smartphones. I also programmed for the client-master communication features using the chatroom framework by Agora to help musicians and VJ to adjust their theme according to the audience's state and the whole sound field.

* Role: Technical Designer & Hardware Engineer
* Period: Janurary 2022 - Present
* Engine: Unity (Oculous VR); Arduino for hardwares.
* Special: EAE Project I course project (semster-long; Alt Control)

This ongoing project is a currently a coursework under the topic of "Alternative Controllers". The Idea comes from the switchable heads of cleaning vacuums. Main Gameplay is that you use physical vacuum gun and shoot in the VR space, with sometimes sucking ammos with another head. I majorly work on the hardware part, about the head detection, wireless communication, and glue codes on the game side. A team of 12 would make efforts on this game in the upcoming months, more heads types, more slots, more mechnics would show up soon.

* Role: Gameplay Programmer
* Period: December 2020 - April 2021
* Engine: Cocos Creator

This game was the main project when I worked at Tantrum Network. I took all programming works of this game from scratch, including the main gameplay, data structure of heroes and enemies, UI framework, animation pipeline, data automation, etc. 

The IP owner later polished and published it on iOS, the UI system updated, but the core gameplay and animation systems retains as when I left this project.

## b) Everyday Dice Game

![](/gallery/Dice1.png)

* Role: Gameplay Programmer
* Period: Feburary 2020 - May 2020
* Engine: Cocos Creator

This game is a contract work from an individual who wanted to bring the experience of rolling dice with friends from the bar to virtual, as the covid breakout made it impossible to gather together in the bar. I systematically learned the rule of the desired dice game, then made it digital with my artist cooperator Chuxian Wang. The core engineer problem is online communication: Finally, I discovered a new cloud framework provided by WeChat, with which I could create sessions for the online play without any server-end codes.

# 3. “Experimental Gameplay” courseworks

## a) Route of Industilization

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzc5MDY0MzUucG5n/315x250%23c/vcyikA.png)

* Role: Solo Game Developer
* Period: One week in Janurary 2022
* Engine: Unity

This game is the first cousework of the "Experimental Gameplay" course, with the theme "Futurism". I tried to develop a jump system in a 2d platformer setting, majorly because I want to learn the creation of a 2d platformer character, including its coding, as well as the animator state machine and the animations by frame. Character part in the [ReTrieve](/post/Retrieve) project is mainly developed by my friend Daemon Pan, so I still want to discover my potential to finish such a game by myself. The double jump mechanic is well profiled and it's nice to have a try. The scoring of this game somehow refelcts the modern China history.

## b) Stinky Snake

![](/gallery/StinkySnake.png)

* Role: Solo Game Developer
* Period: Februray 1st 2022
* Engine: Unity
* Special: EXTREMELY STINKY. You will like it.

Third coursework of the "Experimental Gameplay" course, with the theme "Legacy Game", which means you need to leave some eternal change to the game space across multiple game sessions. This title rethinks the relationship between we human and the influence we made to the environment, and tried to explore what potential effects the "eternal legacy" would provide to us, in an irony way. Developed in exactly one day and have just art/audio assets outsourced.

* Role: Solo Game Developer
* Period: One Week in late Februray 2022
* Engine: Cocos Creater

Sixth coursework of the "Experimental Gameplay" course, with the theme "Match-3 with Twisted Gameplay". As match-3 is majorly ditrbuted on smart phones, I chose cocos creater to create more mobile friendly experience. The twist on traditional match-3 gameplay is "Rotation", as you can see in the video. When you use a mobile device to play this game, the direction friuts falling down will change if you rotate your device. With this new mechanic, you can even rotate the game in certain timing to achieve higher combos. It become popular in some of my friends and should be a novel experience.

* Role: Solo Developer
* Period: Two weeks in November 2019
* Engine: Cocos Creator

This tech demo is a part of my work result in Dr.Stone Popular Science Studio. The students in earth and space science intended to make some physics-based minigames by themselves with cocos creator, and wanted to add a framework to for science-themed interactive dialouges. So I imported the [ink.js](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) library to the cocos proejct, and made a tech demo to excute the file exported from the [inky editor](https://github.com/inkle/inky), to empower the game team to create fun choices and questions.

## b) True Fisrt Person Demo in Unreal

<video  width="100%" height="auto" controls style="aspect-ratio:1080/1920">
    <source src="./TrueFirstPerson.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

* Role: Solo Developer
* Period: Feburay 8th 2022
* Engine: Unreal

This tech demo is a cousework of the "Experimental Gameplay" Course. The theme "Melodramtic" inspired me to create an experience that players are in true first person vision, to take a shower and cleaning body. Alothough the gameplay was not made in any speaking, at least I tried to made the camera binded to the head of the avatars' skeleton, and created the control of the avatar's neck and head with mouse, seperate with the control of movement. I majorly referenced [this article](https://www.froyok.fr/blog/2018-06-true-first-person-camera-in-unreal-engine-4/), using aim offset system in unreal, but also profiled the function and removed the necessity of C++ codes. It works perfectly with just Blueprint.

The potential of this system in gameplay is to enhance the sense of existence of yourself in the world, but also have distinct experience with normal FPS and VR games. In multiplayer games, players can see each others neck move fluently, which is absolutely a novel experience.

### Updated playables will be posted here after final debug & build.

## c) Interactive Comic Framework

* Role: Solo Developer
* Period: One week in Janurary 2021
* Engine: Cocos Creator

This tech demo is a part of my work result at Tantrum Network. Liangzhu was an interactive comic originated from an artist's student-era project made with Unity, and this start-up company wanted to port this project to a platform only support web-version game files. I then researched and developed the warping codes to directly import the psd files with certain layer hierarchy into cocos creator's object hierarchy, and transform them into working interactable comic automaticly. Based on the [Baum.js](https://github.com/kyubuns/Baum2) Photoshop plugin and [Baum2CocosCreator](https://github.com/chooaya/Baum2CocosCreator) library. Also added motion frames and interactable choices.

{% endyoutuber %}

* Role: Game Designer & Gameplay programmer
* Period: a Week in Janurary 2019
* Engine: Unity
* Special: My first game prototype cooperated with experienced teammates.

This prototype is my fisrt piece of work in video game, cooperated with two other experienced programmers and three student artists. For design, I brought up the idea of asymmetric local multiplayer, that one player control the hero with keyboard and the other control the demon king with mouse to trigger the traps. For engineering, I focused on the algorithm of the traps' movement and enemies' logic (especially the creppy flies). I also finished half of the level design, by creating level prefab with the object brush provided by my teammate.
