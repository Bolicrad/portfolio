This project is a 2D platformer game where players could explore multiple themed worlds, using swords and elementary magics to fight against various bosses. I worked on this title for about 4 months with a team of 5, including another programmer and 3 artists. I mainly focused on the design and programming work of enemy AI and Boss Fights. I also instructed the artist team to create the tilemap, designed the level blocks in the 3.0 version, and coded for the level random generating algorithms.

* Special: First performed at Beijing 798 Art Zone. Sponsored by Goethe Institute Beijing.

This project is an interactive music performance experience. I cooperated with musician and artist Clore Cai and tried to provide a space for the audience to contribute to the sound field through their new organ: the smartphone. I used Cocos Creator to create a juicy user interface based on Html5. I utilized WebAudio to make it possible for the players to generate and modify the music from their smartphones. I also programmed for the client-master communication features using the chatroom framework by Agora to help musicians and VJ to adjust their theme according to the audience's state and the whole sound field.

## d) Everyday Dice Game

![](/gallery/Dice1.png)

* Role: Gameplay Programmer
* Duration: Feburary 2020 - May 2020
* Engine: Made with Cocos Creator

This game is a contract work from an individual who wanted to bring the experience of rolling dice with friends from the bar to virtual, as the covid breakout made it impossible to gather together in the bar. I systematically learned the rule of the desired dice game, then made it digital with my artist cooperator Chuxian Wang. The core engineer problem is online communication: Finally, I discovered a new cloud framework provided by WeChat, with which I could create sessions for the online play without any server-end codes.

* Role: Solo Game Developer
* Duration: Originated in May 2019, developed from December 2019 to June 2020
* Engine: Made with Unity (Original Prototype) & Cocos Creator (Publish Version) 
* Special: Serious Game connected with my thesis project for bachelor's degree

This game originated in a hackathon intended to help an NGO enhance its public communication. The NGO has worked on grassland protection and fought against desertification for several years in Northeastern China. I brought up a serious game plan to show their difficulty and finished a prototype within 24 hours. Later, I remade this project into an applet-based game and completed my thesis based on this game's development process and communication effect research.
