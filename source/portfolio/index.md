This project is a 2D platformer game where players could explore multiple themed worlds, using swords and elementary magics to fight against various bosses. I worked on this title for about 4 months with a team of 5, including another programmer and 3 artists. I mainly focused on the design and programming work of enemy AI and Boss Fights. I also instructed the artist team to create the tilemap, designed the level blocks in the 3.0 version, and coded for the level random generating algorithms.

* Role: Game Designer & Programmer

* Engine: Made with Cocos Creator, Agora, WebAudio
* Special: First performed at Beijing 798 Art Zone. Sponsored by Goethe Institute Beijing.

This project is an interactive music performance experience. I cooperated with musician and artist Clore Cai and tried to provide a space for the audience to contribute to the sound field through their new organ: the smartphone. I used Cocos Creator to create a juicy user interface based on Html5. I utilized WebAudio to make it possible for the players to generate and modify the music from their smartphones. I also programmed for the client-master communication features using the chatroom framework by Agora to help musicians and VJ to adjust their theme according to the audience's state and the whole sound field.

This project is an race game that players drives a crazy car in the cit collecting treasure and fuel, avoiding the cop's chase. The highlight is that we have the twitch integration that twitch watcher could use command to produce obstacle or boosters for the player when streaming. I joined the project in the mid-phase and took over the UI function remake, 2D/UI art asset management, as well as technology research works on twitch API.

* Role: Gameplay Programmer
* Duration: December 2020 - April 2021
* Engine: Made with Cocos Creator

This game was the main project when I worked at Tantrum Network. I took all programming works of this game from scratch, including the main gameplay, data structure of heroes and enemies, UI framework, animation pipeline, data automation, etc. 

The IP owner later polished and published it on iOS, the UI system updated, but the core gameplay and animation systems retains as when I left this project.

## e) Everyday Dice Game

![](/gallery/Dice1.png)

* Role: Gameplay Programmer
* Duration: Feburary 2020 - May 2020
* Engine: Made with Cocos Creator

This game is a contract work from an individual who wanted to bring the experience of rolling dice with friends from the bar to virtual, as the covid breakout made it impossible to gather together in the bar. I systematically learned the rule of the desired dice game, then made it digital with my artist cooperator Chuxian Wang. The core engineer problem is online communication: Finally, I discovered a new cloud framework provided by WeChat, with which I could create sessions for the online play without any server-end codes.

* Engine: Made with Unity (Original Prototype) & Cocos Creator (Publish Version) 
* Special: Serious Game connected with my thesis project for bachelor's degree

This game originated in a hackathon intended to help an NGO enhance its public communication. The NGO has worked on grassland protection and fought against desertification for several years in Northeastern China. I brought up a serious game plan to show their difficulty and finished a prototype within 24 hours. Later, I remade this project into an applet-based game and completed my thesis based on this game's development process and communication effect research.

# 2. Prototypes and Tech Demos

## a) Tele-Rang

![](/gallery/Telerang1.jpg)

* Role: Technical Designer and Gameplay Programmer
* Duration: 2 Weeks, August 2021- September 2021
* Engine: Monogame
* Special: First Prototype in EAE Rapid Prototype Course, Ranked Top 3 in peer voting.

This prototype was required to design around a toy boomerang (toy varies among teams). I researched the engines that was allowed and made decision for the team to use Monogame. I explored and inplemented the Monogame.Extended library to the project files, and helped the programmer to finish many features such as animation state machine, movement algorithm, game cycle logics. I also helped producer in pitching for operating the live demo because I was the only one in the team who could pass the hard level.

* Role: Game Designer & Gameplay programmer
* Duration: a Week in Janurary 2019
* Engine: Unity
* Special: My first game prototype cooperated with experienced teammates.

This prototype is my fisrt piece of work in video game, cooperated with two other experienced programmers and three student artists. For design, I brought up the idea of asymmetric local multiplayer, that one player control the hero with keyboard and the other control the demon king with mouse to trigger the traps. For engineering, I focused on the algorithm of the traps' movement and enemies' logic (especially the creppy flies). I also finished half of the level design, by creating level prefab with the object brush provided by my teammate.

This tech demo is a part of my work result at Tantrum Network. Liangzhu was an interactive comic originated from an artist's student-era project made with Unity, and this start-up company wanted to port this project to a platform only support web-version game files. I then researched and developed the warping codes to directly import the psd files with certain layer hierarchy into cocos creator's object hierarchy, and transform them into working interactable comic automaticly. Based on the [Baum.js](https://github.com/kyubuns/Baum2) Photoshop plugin and [Baum2CocosCreator](https://github.com/chooaya/Baum2CocosCreator) library. Also added motion frames and interactable choices.

This tech demo is a part of my work result in Dr.Stone Popular Science Studio. The students in earth and space science intended to make some physics-based minigames by themselves with cocos creator, and wanted to add a framework to for science-themed interactive dialouges. So I imported the [ink.js](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) library to the cocos proejct, and made a tech demo to excute the file exported from the [inky editor](https://github.com/inkle/inky), to empower the game team to create fun choices and questions.
