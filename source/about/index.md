## Who am I

I'm a game developer. No matter which role I performed in a game project, no matter how I get involved in the game project, no matter whether I code or not in the game project, I'm firstly a game developer.

I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in video game production at the University of Utah's [Entertainment Arts and Engineering](https://games.utah.edu). EAE is one of the top video games programs in the world. I create video games with many other talented designers, engineers, and artists here.

I got my bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)). USTC is one of the top research-type institutes in China, which directly belongs to the Chinese Academy of Science. The department I graduated from, the Department of Science and Technology Communication, helped me build a solid knowledge system of media research, media production, and media management.

I'm 24 years old, male. I was born and grew up in Xi'an, China. This three-thousands-year old capital city provides me with a sensitivity of history, geography, and civilization. I'm always curious about the natural and cultural specifications of every location I nested in and could usually become a master of the time and space structure of the region just as the locals.

## What do I do in game development?

* I usually do the design works in collaboration, provide fancy ideas at the pre-production phase of game projects.  
* I also code, both in personal and course projects, 'cause I believe a live demo is the best documentation to show the gameplay in my mind. 
* I use [Machination](https://machinations.io) to simulate and iteration the system design, which helps me build logical systems that players could have fun with. 
* I work on various game engines. Unity, Unreal, Cocos Creator, Monogame, Phaser, etc. Technology would never become a gap between me and fancy gameplays. I even have experience in online-multiplayer games, all coding work done by myself.
* I'm learning some project management skills and software. To be more agile, I will go snowboarding at the Snowbird Resort this snow season.
* Sometimes I cooperate with people who aren't familiar with game creation, such as fine artists, musicians, social workers, or scientists. I utilize my technologies and methodogies of games to help them convey the experiences they wish, to the audience. 

## To Recruiters:

I'm look for a Technical Designer / Gameplay Progammer internship in US for summer 2022

I can never find a better term to describe me other than "Technical Designer." I always feel excited when I find some excellent new tools that might help build innovative gameplays. I'll always think about:

* Can I integrate this new tool into my current game projects? 
* Could I find the best candidate to use this tool to create fancy content? 
* Will it enhance the workflow to reduce unnecessary repeating works? 
* If it has some weakness, can I refine it by modifying its source codes? 

Then I'd take steps to research, implement, apply, and refine those new tools. This cycle could help me in the future in building game creation tools from designer's need. I feel happy when supporting aowsome game designers and cooperate closely with developers and artists.

I understand such position is still not common in the industry, especially for internships, so I'm also developing my design and production skill trees. I also have gameplay programming exerience. If you are looking for a game designer/producer/gameplay programmer intern, I'm still confident to become a candidate. 

## To Artists, Social Workers and Scientists:

I can cooperate with you if:

* You have fancy interactive ideas but lack an experienced developer to cooperate with;
* You have a story about vulnerable groups to tell, but worrying about not able to reach to audience in traditional media;
* You want to show you science researches or just popularize some science concepts to the public, to improve public understanding of science.

I have a full skillset to help you create interactive projects, game or non-game, for your purpose. You can call those projects "Serious Games" as you wish, though I don't really like this term. My undergraducate direction was mass communication for sicence topics, and I have several practices in such area. 

## Thank You for Reading

I hope you can learn some slices of me from those words. Please also check my [portfolio](/portfolio) and [resume](/resume).

Once again, I'm Lei, do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. Not only for recruiting and cooperation, you're also welcomed to discuss with me in many topics about or not about games. Out of a game developer a hardcore game player, but also a hobbist in railways and metro, skiing, urban planning, regional development, geopolitics, consipiracy, urban legends, etc.
