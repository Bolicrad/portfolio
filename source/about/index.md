> Developers, developers, developersâ€¦

I'm a game developer. No matter which role I performed in a game project, no matter how I get involved in the game project, no matter whether I code or not in the game project, I'm firstly a game developer.

I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in video game production at the University of Utah's [Entertainment Arts and Engineering](https://games.utah.edu). EAE is one of the top video games programs in the world. I create video games with many other talented designers, engineers, and artists here.

I got my bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)). USTC is one of the top research-type institutes in China, which directly belongs to the Chinese Academy of Science. The department I graduated from, the Department of Science and Technology Communication, helped me build a solid knowledge system of media research, media production, and media management.

I was born and grew up in Xi'an, China. This three-thousands-year old capital city provides me with a sensitivity of history, geography, and civilization. I'm always curious about the natural and cultural specifications of every location I nested in and could usually become a master of the time and space structure of the region just as the locals.

## What does explicitly I do now?

* I usually do the design works in collaboration, provide fancy ideas at the pre-production phase of game projects.  
* I also code, both in personal and course projects, 'cause I believe a live demo is the best documentation to show the gameplay in my mind. 
* I use [Machination](https://machinations.io) to simulate and iteration the system design, which helps me build logical systems that players could have fun with. 
* I work on various game engines. Unity, Unreal, Cocos Creator, Monogame, Phaser, etc. Technology would never become a gap between me and fancy gameplays. I even have experience in online-multiplayer games, all coding work done by myself.
* I'm learning some project management skills and software. To be more agile, I will go snowboarding at the Snowbird Resort this snow season.
* Sometimes I cooperate with people who aren't familiar with game creation, such as fine artists, musicians, social workers, or scientists. I utilize my technologies and methodogies of games to help them convey the experiences they wish, to the audience. 

## Ideal Position

I can never find a better term to describe me other than "Technical Designer." 

I always feel excited when I find some excellent new tools that might help build innovative gameplays. I'll always think about, can I integrate this new tool into my games? Could I find the best candidate to use this tool to create fancy content? Will it enhance my workflow to reduce unnecessary repeating works? If it has some shortness, can I refine it by modifying its source codes?

Then I'd take steps to research, implement, apply, and refine those new tools. This cycle could help me in the future in building game creation tools from scratch. I understand this position is not so common in the industry, especially for internships, so I'm also developing my design and production skill trees. If you are looking for a game designer/producer intern, I'm still confident to become a candidate.

I hope you can learn some slices of me. Once again, I'm Lei, do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested, not only for recruiting, you're also welcome for cooperation or just discussion.
