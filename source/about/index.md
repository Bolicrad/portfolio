## Who am I?

I'm a game developer. No matter which role I performed in a game project, no matter how I get involved in the game project, no matter whether I code or not in the game project, I'm firstly a game developer.

I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in game production at the University of Utah's [Entertainment Arts and Engineering](https://games.utah.edu), a fantastic video games graduate programs. I create video games with many other talented designers, engineers, and artists here.

I got my bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)), one of the top-tier researching institutes in China, which directly belongs to the Chinese Academy of Science. The department I graduated from, the Department of Science and Technology Communication, helped me build a solid knowledge system of media research, media production, and media management.

In 1997, I was born in Xi'an, China. This 3000 year historical capital city provides me with a sensitivity of history, geography, and civilization. I'm always curious about the natural and cultural specifications of every location I moved to, and can usually become a master of the time and space structure of that region, just as the locals.

## What's my role in game development?

* Designer: I usually do the design works in collaboration, provide fancy ideas at the pre-production phase of game projects.  
* Prototyper: I also code, both in personal and course projects, 'cause I believe a live demo is the best documentation to show the gameplay in my mind. 
* Engineer: I work with various game engines. Unity, Unreal, Cocos Creator, Monogame, GameMaker, etc. Technology would never become a gap between me and fancy gameplays. I have experience in online-multiplayer games, all by myself with custom cloud side codes.
* Producer: I'm have learned some project management and team communication skills. To be more agile, I will go snowboarding at the Snowbird Resort next snow season.

## To Recruiters:

I'm looking for a Technical Designer internship or part-time position in US for summer 2022

I can never find a better term to describe me other than "Technical Designer." I always feel excited when I find some excellent new tools that might help build innovative gameplays. I'll always think about:

* Can I integrate this new tool into my current game projects? 
* Could I find the best candidate to use this tool to create fancy content? 
* Will it enhance the workflow to reduce unnecessary repeating works? 
* If it has some weakness, can I refine it by modifying its source codes? 

Then I'd take steps to research, implement, apply, and refine those new tools. This cycle could help me in building game creation tools from designer's need. I feel happy when supporting aowsome game designers and cooperate closely with developers and artists.

I understand that such position is still not common in the industry, especially for internships, so I'm also developing my design skill trees, with gameplay programming practices. If you are looking for a game designer intern or gameplay engineer intern, I'm still confident to be a candidate. 

## To Artists, Social Workers, and Scientists:

Sometimes I cooperate with people who aren't familiar with game creation, such as artists, musicians, social workers, or scientists. I utilize my technologies and methodogies of games to help them convey the experiences they wish, to the audience. I can cooperate with you if you're:

* An artist: You have fancy interactive ideas but lack an experienced developer to cooperate with;
* A social worker: You have a story about vulnerable groups to tell, but worrying about not being able to reach to audience in traditional media;
* A scientist: You want to show your science researches or popularize some science concepts to the public, to improve public understanding of science.

I have a full skill set to help you create interactive projects, game or non-game, for your purpose. You can call those projects "Serious Games" as you wish, though I don't really like this term. My undergraduate direction was mass communication for science topics, and I have several such cross-disciplinary practices on file.

## Thank You for Reading

I hope you can learn some aspects of me from those words. Please also check my [portfolio](/portfolio) and [resume](/resume).

Once again, I'm Lei, do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. Not only for recruiting and cooperation, but you're also welcome to discuss many topics about or not about games with me. 

Besides being a game developer and a hardcore gamer, I'm also a hobbyist in the railway system, snowboarding, urban planning, regional development, geopolitics, urban legends, etc.
